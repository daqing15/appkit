It's developed on fedora 17 & Gnome Desktop,  \r\nHowever, It could be compatible with Ubuntu 12.04 and so on.\r\n\r\n\"AppKit\" will be a framework for desktop application powered by [WebKit](http://www.webkit.org/) engine, which means we can bring web technology such as HTML5, CSS3, Javascript and Web browser engine to desktop.\r\n\r\nThe main goal for now is to focus on library API which is inspired by [Flask](http://flask.pocoo.org/) :). Application based on AppKit should be easy to write & combined with other libraries ( [Bootstrap](http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/), [AngularJS](http://angularjs.org/), [Jinja2](http://jinja.pocoo.org/docs/) or whatever that you can think of :P )\r\n\r\n## Target Platforms:\r\nLinux, Mac OSX, Windows\r\n\r\n## Installation:\r\nUse Python `pip` command\r\n```\r\n$ pip install git+git://github.com/nitipit/appkit.git\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Usage:\r\n```\r\n#!/usr/bin/env python\r\n\r\nfrom appkit.app import App\r\n\r\napp = App()\r\n\r\n\r\n@app.route('^/$')\r\ndef home():\r\n    return '<a href=\"app:///test/Hello/World/\" />Link</a>'\r\n\r\n\r\n@app.route('/test/(.+)/(.+)/')\r\ndef test(text1=None, text2=None):\r\n    return ('<h1>' + text1 + ' ' + text2 + '</h1>', 'text/html')\r\n\r\napp.run()\r\n```\r\n\r\n![screenshot-1](https://raw.github.com/nitipit/appkit/master/doc/1.png)\r\n![screenshot-2](https://raw.github.com/nitipit/appkit/master/doc/2.png)","note":"Don't delete this file!
